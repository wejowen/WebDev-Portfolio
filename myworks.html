            David Tune of Boambee, NSW, was reminded of a particularly clever
            pair of IT Diploma students who handed in a joint research
            assignment, complete with the required signed statement that it was
            all their original work.

          <p>
            Tune recalls: "Upon reading the work for grading, I was incredibly
            impressed to find three pages of the document written in perfect
            technical German, particularly given that the students in question
            were none too articulate when I asked 'Sprechen sie Deutsch?' End
            result: assignment rejected, students counselled and more care taken
            when cutting and pasting to cover assignment work.

            Anyone attending an IT lecture should expect that the lecturer knows

            "I was told to set up a projector in one of the meeting rooms for
            school staff, as there was a presentation. Having done that, I
            hooked the presentation laptop to the network and tried to help one
            of the speakers from the IT faculty update the laptop to IE7. I
            logged off and asked her to log on with her account to try IE7.
          </p>
          <p>
            'What is that?' she asked when the IE7 install process asked whether
            phishing should be turned on. After I explained it, she told me that
            she was about to present a talk on internet security."

          <h2>TUTORING THE TUTOR</h2>
        </header>
        <section>
          <p>
            Neil Meyers, library assistant from Gilles Plains in SA, recalls an
            incident with a part-time computer lecturer a couple of years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I work in a vocational education library, and, on night shift,
            library staff are the default computer technicians/troubleshooters.
            One night, this part-time lecturer came to the counter, stating that
            she'd managed to get a CD-ROM disc stuck in the drive. She also said
            she felt a bit foolish, because she was instructing a class in basic
            computing and was unable to solve the problem in front of a room
            full of students.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I wandered over to give her assistance, pushed the drive eject
            button, out popped the tray and... no disc to be seen.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            Before I was able to ask out the obvious question, she piped up,
            'That's the CD drive? I thought it was the other one!', pointing to
            an old 5.25in floppy disc slot, which was there even though the
            drives themselves had long since been decommissioned.
          </p>
          <p>
            Someone from IT got out the disc the next day when they upended the
            machine and it fell out. Then, a week later, after I gave the
            lecturer her CD back, she was back within five minutes, saying, 'You
            won't believe it, I've done it again!'
          </p>
          <p>
            And this was their computing tutor? So there I am in front of her
            class, shaking the heck out of the machine. So much for teaching
            people to handle their computers with care!"

            Ian Caldewell, a self-styled 'PC tinkerer', refurbishes PCs, and has
            ways of acquiring modems, monitors, CPUs, boxes and RAM - to the
            point where it has become a pastime consuming most of his leisure
            time. He now has streams of people seeking repairs, advice and
            assistance.

            "Recently, I replaced an old power supply for a couple, and, when
            they came to collect, they asked whether I made house calls.

          <p>I said I could and asked what they needed."</p>
          <p>
            The lady told Caldewell she'd bought a new wireless mouse, and,
            since it was the last one on display, it didn't come with a box or
            instructions.

            Chris Aitken, a designer and programmer from Camden, NSW, believes
            his story proves that tech support is one of the most stressful jobs
            on earth. He recalls working for a small internet provider in the
            late '90s, when one of the customers was a local police officer.
          </p>
          <p>
            "He was also an expert in crashing Windows 98. On one occasion, he
            brought his tower into the office, sat it on the counter, pulled his
            service pistol out of his holster and pointed it straight at the
            tower, threatening to shoot it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another time he put his (by now very nervous) PC tower onto the
            counter, again took out his pistol, held it by the barrel and
            started banging the butt of the gun onto the top of the computer,
            quite hard too.
